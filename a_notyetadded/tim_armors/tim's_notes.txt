brass dye, crafted from one silver dye and one copper dye, makes 2 dyes 
(recipe not added, but dye tested and functional.)



knight set not yet animated, gonna need some work



spacepunk set fully animated, but I couldn't figure out how to make the helmet glass dyeable. 

rest of set is fully dyeable, with default palette matching brick because burgundy and gold make me happy. 

backitem is totally unworked, supposed to end up being a steampunk tank for breathing apparatuseses, apparati? 
whatever. I would use the base game's steampunk back as a base (the one that goes with the steam-puffing top hat. set 
has no recipe currently, would suggest copper silver and leather as some ingredients. set was built around novakids, 
but should work for anyone going for a steampunk aesthetic.
