Class: Penumbra
Size: Medium
Gravity same as Earth

- Planet main features:
Cracks, crevices, mountains and volcanoes dot the entire surface
Unstable tectonic plates, constantly moving
Core consists of some unknown mix of materials, constantly emitting some sort of gas through the cracks and volcanoes
Said gas is the food source for the flora, which grows mostly around those cracks (Much like a fire produces smoke, the planets core chemical reaction produces this)
Deep lakes and seas dot the surface, but no oceans. (Water is still crucial)
A layer, much like a very dense version of Earths ozone and/or magnetic field that repels most of the sun light and its other emissives
There seems to be a weak spot or a hole in it which lets through a high amount of sun emissives, essentially scorching everything underneat it when exposed to the sun as the flora and fauna are not built to withstand it
However, said "death ray" plays a crucial part in the planets ecosystem by evaporating water caught in its area and tunring it into clouds, thus bringing water to other places around the globe
Should this hole in the layer not exist, the planet would've been mostly barren with life only surrounding the water holes

- Flora main features:
Fast reproduction, short lifespan, bioluminescent green-yellow
Appears mostly blurry as the fibers seems to refract light in an odd fashion
No specific pattern to coloration, mostly dark purple-gray
Only requirement is low amounts of water and the specific air found on the planet which is a weird mixture exhumed by the odd materials found inside the planets core

- Fauna main features:
Biggest creatures are about the same size as a Nightar, as anything bigger would require a lot more food than it could find.
Fast reproduction with lifespans based on the creatures general size, with the bigger and longer living creatures found mostly underground.
Water is still crucial
