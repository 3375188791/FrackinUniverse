			"psionics1"		: [ "Psionics",			"^orange;Tier 1^reset;\n\nYou've learned that the brain is a marvellous thing, and unlocking its secrets is only the beginning. To really dig in you'll need to...dig in. Are there ethical issues with removing brains from subjects? Yes. Do you care? Probably not...\n\nYou can now harvest brains from subjects for further study with the use of a Brain Extractor." ],

Your next task is to learn to use your own mind to do impossible things. You can start by connecting with your Astral self...who knows what awaits beyond that." ],

			"weapon2"		: [ "Particle Entropy",		"^orange;Tier 2^reset;\n\nConventional physics says that all energy simply becomes something else, and that nothing is truly ever destroyed. You've used this to your advantage, and have uncovered the secrets to altering how entropy itself applies to particles. You can reach right into subspace and manipulate the fabric of reality!" ],
			"weapon3"		: [ "Biomorphic Particles",	"^orange;Tier 3^reset;\n\nYou've uncovered the impossible: how to fuse living tissue with the very fabric of the cosmos without destroying either subject. The potential for this is impossible to imagine. Living spacecraft! Entire planets seeded with life overnight! They'll see, because you'll show them." ],
			"weapon4"		: [ "Reality Bridge",		"^orange;Tier 4^reset;\n\nThe Reality Bridge is a new theory you've created that states that all things in creation are connected to all other things in creation, regardless of their dimensional phase. You can link biology with technology, biomass with particle antimatter...there is nothing beyond your reach." ]
