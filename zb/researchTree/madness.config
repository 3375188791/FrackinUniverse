			"psionics1"		: [ "Psionics",			"^orange;Tier 1^reset;\n\nYou've begun to delve into the science of psionics, and don't care much for what your peers think about it. You've learned that the brain is a marvellous thing, and unlocking its secrets is only the beginning. You can now harvest brains from subjects for further study." ],
			"psionics2"		: [ "Eloptic Energy",		"^orange;Tier 2^reset;\n\nThe energy that binds all things, the very life-essence of the cosmos, is at long last a thing you can quantify. While the results are less than concrete, you cannot deny the truths you have discovered in your studies. You can use brains and this 'Eloptic Energy' to accomplish incredible things." ],
			"psionics3"		: [ "Astral Projection",	"^orange;Tier 3^reset;\n\nNot only have you proven psionics are real, you've learned to harness the brain itself to grant untold possibilities to science! Your next task is to learn to use your own mind to do impossible things. You can start by connecting with your Astral self...who knows what awaits beyond that." ],

With a bit of patience and study you could even learn to send messages or even -cross over- to the other side! The potential here is staggering, but the risk is equally high. You should take precautions before doing anything too crazy." ],

You seek to learn of how living things work, no matter how exotic. What you do with that knowledge then, well...that's another matter entirely. Flesh is your canvas, and many would disagree with your methods. So long as nobody knows...nobody will mind. Right?" ],

But you aren't interested in just the DNA sequences...no, you seek something grander. A symphony you can play on flesh and show the universe how truly beautiful life is, whether they agree with you or not." ],
			"genes3"		: [ "Reanimation",		"^orange;Tier 3^reset;\n\nLife and Death are only suggestions to you. You have learned to work within both the realm of the living and that of the dead. By fusing the two, you will accomplish the long-sought secret of eternal life, and so much more. Your perception of reality isn't what it used to be, though, and you've a tenuous grasp on things...at best." ],

Lucky for you, nobody is as smart as you are. You've dreamt of a mathmatical formula that has been driving you slowly mad...but you've solved it! The Quadratic Time Cube Theory! It gives you limited insight into the ebb and flow of time!" ],
			"weapon2"		: [ "Particle Entropy",		"^orange;Tier 2^reset;\n\nConventional physics says that all energy simply becomes something else, and that nothing is truly ever destroyed. You've used this to your advantage, and have uncovered the secrets to altering how entropy itself applies to particles. You can reach right into subspace and manipulate the fabric of reality!" ],
			"weapon3"		: [ "Biomorphic Particles",	"^orange;Tier 3^reset;\n\nYou've uncovered the impossible: how to fuse living tissue with the very fabric of the cosmos without destroying either subject. The potential for this is impossible to imagine. Living spacecraft! Entire planets seeded with life overnight! They'll see, because you'll show them." ],
			"weapon4"		: [ "Reality Bridge",		"^orange;Tier 4^reset;\n\nThe Reality Bridge is a new theory you've created that states that all things in creation are connected to all other things in creation, regardless of their dimensional phase. You can link biology with technology, biomass with particle antimatter...there is nothing beyond your reach." ]
