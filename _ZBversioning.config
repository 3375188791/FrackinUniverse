Welcome to Ztarbound; A mod that aims to improve some of the untouched by mods vanilla aspects and add some more tools for modders to play with!

This window, added by this mod, is here to guide new and old users through some basic mod info and important changes, including, but not limited to, changelogs, extra information, and credits.*

Normally, these windows cannot be closed instantly when called by a mods update, a newly created character(Because of limitations), or when installing a new mod. But don't worry, they'll be closable after a short period of time displayed in the bottom left of the window.**

You can open this window manually if you have the StardustLib or QuickBar mod installed.

Want your mod to use this feature? Not a problem! Head on to the 'Information' tab, you'll find everything you need there.

Be advised - This mod is integrated into Frackin' Universe, and does not require the standalone version. If you have the standalone version installed alongside FU, remove the standalone version as to not slow down Starbounds loading time.

Thanks, and have fun! :)

* - The information provided depends on whether the mod in question is using this feature, and the info itself is provided by said mods author.

** - Technically, you CAN close the window, but it'll re-open itself, and reset the timer. :)

	"info" : "
Ztarbound started as an addition to FU, aiming to expand upon some of the untouched vanilla features, as well as provide modders with extra features they can utilize.

If you wish to utilize any of the modder assets, there are clear instructions in the template provided on the mods page, and examples available on the decompiled version of this mod which is also available on the mods page.

> ^green;Revamped NPC space station interaction:^reset;

The main NPC vendors on non-player space stations have been replaced with an interactable front desk, which allows you to trade a wider variety of goods through an entirely different system, buy and sell regular items, and access unique options depending on the station type!

^green;Medical stations^reset; allow the purchase of powerful enhancers that modify your character in a unique way, but also feature downsides to compensate. They last until you die, or until you remove it at any medical station. Only one enhancer can be active at a time. Every station features different options, so be sure to check every new station you find!

^red;Military stations^reset; allow hiring a (usually) unique crew members. Stations allow only one crew member per player, so should you want another one, find another military station. The crew you can pick from varies between stations, so be sure to check new stations out!

^orange;Trading stations^reset; take investments that change the shops prices in your favor, bot for buying and selling. Should you invest enough, you'll get a permanent bonus that affects all stations, regardless of their type. This bonus stacks with itself, so if you want really good deals, you better start investing in a lot of them!

^cyan;Science stations^reset; [PLACEHOLDER] Currently mimics a random space station.

> ^green;Research Panel:^reset;

A research panel which allows you to learn crafting recipes through research instead of picking up items.

+ Less lag when picking up items or moving them in/out of inventory if it has a lot of recipes learned on pickup

? A stricter progression that prevents easy tier skips (depends on how its set up by the modder)

- Might be painful for the modder to set up
