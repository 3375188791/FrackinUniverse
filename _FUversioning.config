Welcome to ^green;Frackin' Universe^reset;!
Don't be afraid mod user, this window is here to inform you about important updates, and provide some basic info about a few things.
Don't worry, this window will pop-up only when you enter a new character or when entering an already existing character after an FU update.
So lets begin shall we?
____________________________________________________________________
     ^cyan;New in version 5.5.2^reset;
 - Added this popup Update screen (zimberzimber)
 - The early implementation of a new Research UI. You cannot currently access it as a player, for there is a lot of work to do on the back end for this update still (research trees, costs etc). But the basics are there for use.
 - Added Space Station Revamp : 
____________________________________________________________________
     ^orange;What do Stations Do Now?^reset;
 - The vendor in space stations is now replaced with a console. (you can't miss it) Upon interaction, you will be greated with a new interface through which you'll be accessing the new features. In addition, theres flavored dialogue, and an animated talker! (Currently just a gray AI, but will be replaced with races later, along with race fitting texts)
 - Instead of being able to buy one type of goods, and sell only one in a station, you can now buy and sell any of the goods, including new ones!
In addition, goods are no longer an item and do not take up inventory space, they are currency, acting like pixels or essence for the matter. Goods buy/sell prices depend on the stock of the station.
If a station has a lot of something, its value will be low, but if they don't have much of it, the value increases!
Stock also largely depends on the type of station you're visiting. Trading stations have a lot of minerals and will gladly buy electronics, but scientific stations have lots of electronics, and are in need of minerals!
Buy for low, sell fo high, and soon you'll be making a nice profit!
 - You can now buy/sell things at shops. But the stock is different from station to station, and is themed after the station type! (medical selling stimpaks, military selling weapons, etc...) Some things can even affect the prices in your favor...
 - Medical stations let you buy unqiue, long lasting, persisting-through-death buffs (aka enhancers) which have strong effects, but also come with some downsides. In addition, you can only purchase an enhancer once every long period of time. But should the effect vore you, you can always remove it at any medical station. Each station has different options to choose from.
 - Military stations let you hire a single (per station) crew member. But its not one of your generic "ty 4 finding muh frind" kind of member, they all pack quite a punch and are definitly worth your time!
 -  Trading stations accept investments from outside sources, and will gladly shift the shops prices in your favor should you invest enough. If you're super generous, they'll make sure to spread your name across the stars, modifying prices in your favor across all space stations.
 -  Scientific stations are still in progress. But for now, they turn into another, random station
 - Those unqiue, long lasting, persisting-through-death buffs obtained from medical station which I mentioned earlier? Their effects are quite strong, but their downside is heavy as well. Not every enhancers fits every play style, but I'm sure you'll find something you like! You can tell what each enhancer does simply by clicking them in the medical special menu.
