  ^cyan;New in version 5.6.313^reset;
  
  * adjusted sizes of each layer in Huge, Mega, Immense and Mammoth sized worlds, which should hopefully solve a weird layering issue that results in blank sections
  
  * Wells now have reduced effectiveness based on proximity to other wells. This radius is 16 tiles. Each additional well within this radius will impact efficiency. 
  
  * added Psionic Loader. Place your ammo in the left slot and your Focus in the right, and it will merge the ammo into the magazine. (Kherae)
  
  * The crew deed BYOS quest should now require a crew deed instead of a crappy crew bed (Hubnester)

  * Drastically increased conversion time on Precursor Converters and Faulty Converters
  
  * Varan Berry now gives Immunity genes when xeno'd , rather than regen. This should plug a small hole in the progression tree with Immunity.

  * Avian sarcophagi have a chance to drop Wrapped Bodies

  * corrected a typo on Antediluvian Texts(naehc)
