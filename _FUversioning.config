  * Slayer armor set, and stranglevine thorn effects , should no longer proc annoying orange outlines

__________________________________________________
  ^cyan;New in version 5.6.279^reset;
  
  * added Eld'uu furniture and decorations (Shinigami Apples)
  
  * Precursor Generators now required Antineutronium and Neutronium present before they can function. They will not consume these two resources. (Kherae)
  
  * updated Precursor Generator UI. Fuel goes in the left slot. Right slots hold antineutronium and neutronium
  
  * renamed Precursor Generator to Precursor Reactor
  
  * hunting should always proc the correct loot when using non-physical damage when applying direct damage. DoT and AoE effects still inhibit this loot.
  
  * added a missing slime lootlist type
  
  * Fixed syntax in the tale of the Nightar Matriarch (AbsoluteZeroX)
  
  * Elder Disruptor Pistol and Disruptor have had some changes made to their function, projectile sprites and feel.
  
  * all Elder weapons now have their own tooltip UI
  
  * Spankr should no longer crash the client on alt-fire due to an oversight in the rework of Radiation Burn
  
  * Lightning Storms are a bit more dangerous, with some strikes leaving electrically charged spots when they strike
  
  * Shock Shrooms have some added punch
  
  * Hurricane weather on Fungal biomes replaced with Fungal Hurricane weather (still displays as Hurricane on navigation map)
  
  * added Electric Storm weather. Creates areas of electricity on the ground that can cause damage as well as stun and electrified status.
  
  * added Static Charge weather. No outward effects, but the air becomes charged with the Electrified status.
  
  * Densinium weapons should all properly count in Densinium set bonuses
  
  * relocated Xi ranged weapons. if your bulb gun mucks up, throw and pick it up again. Should set it right again.
  
  * X'i food effect (FrackinRaces) no longer grants absurd values to health and energy. Wrong data gave you thousands of HP and Energy. oops!
  
  * X'i armors should properly append bonuses to X'i Bulb regeneration. Their rates have also been increased to reduce the need to camp as often
  
  * added X'ian Pistol nerfed: Damage and knockback reduced. Fire time increased. Now stuns all targets in range.
  
  * added X'ian Acid Gun : able to do a fair amount of damage, its main draw is that it can stick to targets and melt tiles. This allows it to be used for mining.
  
  * added X'ian Radthrower : cause radiation burn to foes
  
  * added X'ian Armcannon
  
__________________________________________________
  ^cyan;New in version 5.6.278^reset;
  
  * added Upgrade Table. This functions similar to a Precursor Crucible, or the vanilla Anvil. It upgrades +1 tier at a time, and uses Upgrade Modules. It cannot go higher than tier 6. Items upgraded here do not obtain their 'upgraded skin' if they have one. That requires the previously mentioned Anvil or Crucible. The Crucible remains the top choice for item upgrading.
  
  * Radiation Burn (Rad Burn) has been revised. It now damages Physical Resistance first, and then attacks your health at a much faster rate than previous, but at much lower damage. It also has visual effect changes. No more words!
  
  * added Darkmatter Burst weather type to several subbiomes and several biome types
  
  * added Sulphuric Fog weather to sulphuric biomes and several other harsh biome types
  
  * added Cosmic Blast weather type to Cyberspheres and Aether Seas
  
  * Zerchesium Shield icon corrected (wannas)
  
  * X'i : added Reactive Gel (healing item) in 3 tiers, Shield, Tier 2, 4 and 6 armors.
  
  * X'ian Bulb Gun properly counts as hunting weapon. 
  
  * X'ian Spear damage reduced
  
  * X'i staff has had its useless healzone changed. It now casts Entropic Warding.
  
  * recipe for Algae has changed
  
  * Servitor Loader renamed to Bot Loader to be less confusing. It has also received UI wording adjustments.
  
  * Ranged weapon scaling adjustment (laz2727)

  * X'i healing with Bulb plants is more obvious (added particle effects) (FrackinRaces)
  
  * X'i have a chance to spawn Mutant and Alpha bulbs which are more effective at healing as ordinary bulbs. (FrackinRaces)

__________________________________________________
  ^cyan;New in version 5.6.277^reset;
  
  * added Zerchesium Shield (Dr.Wasabi)
  
  * Nonuniform mod should no longer be making crew naked (Mobius58)
  
  * StardustLib was already present in the metadata for the Quickbar. The stand-alone version QuickbarMini was not. Sometimes the load order will change to the point where the Quickbar is loaded after Frackin Universe, overwriting any changes FU makes
This PR will ensure StardustLib and/or QuickbarMini will always load before FU. (SilverFeelin)

  * Radien have been renamed to X'i. They remain otherwise untouched in FU. Their 'Frackin Races' bonuses will be updated soon.
  
  * Radien (X'ian) flag changed
  
  * X'ian have several racial weapons added. These are only obtainable if you also have FrackinRaces installed. This is intentional. Both mods are required to make the most of this race.
  
  * crafted Shortspears have been given Knockback to make them more desirable weapons
  
  * Longswords should all appear in the 1-handed melee slot in the Armory
  
  * Longsword damage has been nerfed to make them on-par with other melee weapons, rather than the obviously superior choice in every situation.
  
  * Prismatic Rapier tooltip now properly lists Crit and Crit Damage Bonus modifiers
