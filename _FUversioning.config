__________________________________________________
  ^cyan;New in version 5.6.32^reset;
  
  * Masters (Adv Alloy) weapons re-tiered to where they were intended to be. They were erroneously tier 5
  
  * fixed tiering on several other weapons
  
  * Madness accrued from the Insanity effect per cycle increased from 1d4 to 1d6
  
  * increased madness gained from the various madness treasure pools
  
  * added a dedicated 'madness' effect icon to make it more clear when you are affected by madness
  
  * Greg.
  
  * Reworked the Network Guide (Terminal/Recumen)
  
  * Moons should have a more robust selection of ores to reduce grind and increase the value of moon visits
  
  * Proto-Rifle damage reduced, and its impact explosion damage has been nerfed. It was vastly over-performing.
  
  * Nomad Rifle and Nomad Combat Rifle are both more expensive to build
  
  * Nomad Rifle and Nomad Combat Rifle had been moved from tier 4 to tier 3 where they were intended to be
  
  * Nomad Rifle ahas had its damage reduced from 8 to 7.
  
  * Nomad Combat Rifle has had its alt-fire changed
  
  * Increased energy-per-shot cost of Scorchburst, and reduced its damage output by 0.8.
  
  * Swashbuckler armor should now properly function
  
  * added Dense Alloy furniture set (Shinigami Apples)
  
  * added Penumbrite furniture set (Shinigami Apples)
  
  * Manipulator Modules, Tech Cards and Upgrade Modules are more expensive to produce, which should make them a more valuable commodity.
  
  * harpoons should properly move in water

  * liquid collectors, atmospheric condensers, and entropic converters are now subject to the same proximity based penalty mechanic as wells. collectors have a 9 tile range, while the other 2 have 30 tile range. also changed the latter 2 to use a different script update mechanic. (Kherae)  

__________________________________________________
  ^cyan;New in version 5.6.313^reset;
  
  * adjusted sizes of each layer in Huge, Mega, Immense and Mammoth sized worlds, which should hopefully solve a weird layering issue that results in blank sections
  
  * Wells now have reduced effectiveness based on proximity to other wells. This radius is 16 tiles. Each additional well within this radius will impact efficiency. 
  
  * added Psionic Loader. Place your ammo in the left slot and your Focus in the right, and it will merge the ammo into the magazine. (Kherae)

  * Converters require more per resource to generate Quantum Fluid, to minimize mass-scale essence farm efficiency. This is to encourage use of Soul Leaf instead, as intended.
  
  * Avian sarcophagi have a chance to drop Wrapped Bodies and other loot
  
  * added two new madness-granting items to the Metascience tree: Carving and Impossible Theories
