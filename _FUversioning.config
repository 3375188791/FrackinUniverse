  * Reworks all (yes, all) of the weather scripts in stats/effects/fu_weathereffects/new/* to make full use of the base library. I have done this in an object-oriented (class-based) way, so they can simply extend and modify the behaviours of the base class. (wannas)
  
  * Rewrites the weather config .statuseffect files. I have attempted to keep as many of the numbers and parameters for each weather type in these files, keeping hard-coding in Lua to a minimum. This means that tweaks and balance changes (and even extra weather types) can be done exclusively in the JSON. (wannas)

  * Energy EPPs now block Lightning Storm effects. (wannas)
