Welcome to Frackin' Universe version ^orange;1.0^reset;!
Don't be afraid mod user, this window is here to inform you about important updates, and provide some basic info about a few things.
Don't worry, this window will pop-up only when yu enter a new character (there's a reason for that, trust me), or when entering an already existing character after an FU update.
So lets begin shall we?
