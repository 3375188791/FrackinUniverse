_____________________________________________________
  ^cyan;New in version 5.6.241^reset;
  
  * REGARDING NEW SAIL INTERFACE: if your Race mod 'Includes' FU (to force it to load after FU) it will *not* function with the new SAIL. This means Avali are screwed for now. However, we may opt to release an addon that loads after all the custom races to combat this issue. Have patience!

  * Pretty straightforward. Park ship on the orbit of planet, and Atmospheric Condenser will collect planetary resources, like it's built on the surface. (Vollch)
