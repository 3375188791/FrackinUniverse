  " Our current king is Gin Yorukishi, the third of his name, the 15th king of the Nightars, also known as the night's king.
  
  He's been leading the nightars for the last 2 decades, he lived in the nightfort for his whole life, and became the king of the Nightar after he successfully defeated his 2 older brothers in fair combat.",
  
  " He defended the Nightfort from every intruder, be it monsters, humans,and everything else! Now that i think about it, i remember seeing him bring a huge dragon to the castle today, I wonder where it came from.
  Anyways, that's our king, and we are proud of him."
