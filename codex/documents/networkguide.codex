Well, item networking uses those. Yus. Most important part: if cat left labeling on it, read the label. It's not there for the cat's amusement, that's your job.",
  "^green;Container Links:^white; these are uberuseful little noms. They're also self-centered, so don't expect them to care about their ^red;inputs^white; or ^blue;outputs^white;. They won't. Same with much of the FU machinery. It does its job, ignores everything else. Plug them into ^green;repeaters^white; or ^green;routers^white;, their job is to relay stuff. Oh, right, how they work: they look for the nearest container, measured from center to center. Then they just squawk about it all day.",
  "^green;Repeaters^white;: Parrots. PARROTS! Noisy little birds that talk all day to each other. They just pass along the who-is-who. Never try to give them items, they just eat them or use them as nesting material.",
  "^green;Routers^white; part 1: Important part of all item networks. It handles all the item movement. Current interface includes ^red;input^white; slot filters, which umm...let you pick which slots to take from. Router inputs are very explicit. Power on left, network on right. Interface also includes ^blue;output^white; slot filtering. choose what slots to put stuff into. Very useful. Sometimes you only want to load a centrifuge or arc smelter with the tasty noms that you want melted or swirled...and want them to come out melty or swirly. That's what this is for. Plan to make slot filters accept input ranges. will be using (-) sign. Maybe after a nap. Also want to add invert button to input and output slot lists.",
  "^green;Routers^white; part 2: UI has many options on it. don't look like previous models, but still simple to understand. ^green;Inv. Logic^white; is...umm...well, it takes the condition out, inverts it, and makes it a logical AND. Great if you don't want grapefruit in your fruitbowl, but want all the other fruits. There's also filtering for ^green;Exact Match, Type Match (Item Category), and Category Match (Groups of Categories)^white;.",

  "^green;Pumps and quarries^white;:\n Pretty toys. bring shiny tasty noms to you with minimal effort. Cat won't teach finer points. Just remember that ^blue;left inputs are for power switch, right for alternate mode,^white; and ^red;outputs are for items, optionally liquids.^white; Alternate modes...nya...pump will just dump liquids through its liquid outfit, if connected.
