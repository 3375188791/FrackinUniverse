"There exists a brotherhood so strange in its mundane roots that it has never truly been explored. In this weeks docu-series we examine the elaborate and often bizarre handshakes....of the Apex during adolescence. A biproduct of their mating cycle, it allows females to know which male is ready to impregnate her.",
"It sounds crude when dressed down to that level, but is it really so different from you or I? Snexnor was first of his brood pod, and after eating his hivemates he emerged as the strongest and won the largest female. Thanks to that, he was eaten -first- during the Festival of Birth! And that's only one of thousands of other species!",
"In any case, there are some handshakes among these teenaged Apex that border on absurd. Take this example: ^cyan;[hologram forms]^reset; note that there are more than 230 different motions in this handshake. It must be returned by the recipient in perfect sequence on the first attempt...or there will be trouble!"
