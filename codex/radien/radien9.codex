"Team x5a - Radien are the subject of my team's focus. Very little is known about them, which only makes them more interesting to study. While most of us know even less than usual about this race, we do have some speculations not widely accepted or considered by most historians.",
"One of said speculations is that the Radien are from another universe entirely. Their body chemistry resembles nothing of what we've seen in our home universe, and it seems like only very specialized diseases have much effect on them. They seem almost improbable for existing, and yet here they are.",
"Studying runes and books put us on a lead toward more religious information. Recently, we discovered a massive hologram depicting a furry beast well over the size of a planet. We speculate that this is one of the gods they worship. The translation of its name from runes appears to be ^orange;'ORANA'^reset;."
