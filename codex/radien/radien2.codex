"Radien deny the idea of a Cultivator creating the six races and six artifacts. Despite them being so religious, they are oddly advocates of evolution. Studying their history books, we find no mention of a Cultivator, but plenty of mention of a great ''CREATOR''. The name is disputed, though a small majority claims its name is 'Xuveh'. Having not heard of this being before, we have little reason to believe it exists. Perhaps that is their reasoning for denying the Cultivator."
