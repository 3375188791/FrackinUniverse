"The lead diplomat of the Radien race is named Ruppur Gentilly. She's one of the few that can speak enough Common to communicate with us, as well as one of the few that is willing to speak with us at all. No Radien has ever been recorded to be taller than her-- if leaders were chosen by height alone, she'd be a good fit. Standing at 12'7'' or 384cm, she towers over our team of shrimpy humans. It's a little imposing.",
"Ruppur tells tales of how she fought in a war between stars and black holes, and how she helped drive the stars away to save the near-extinct black holes. We aren't quite sure, but we believe the stars may, in fact, be Novakid. This gives us a little insight on those mysterious beings."
