"Radien have spent time living around Novakid for longer than any organic race can say. As typical of Novakid, they don't seem to remember much about their relationship with this other race, but not one has talked poorly of Radien. Some have mentioned being fond of a Radien's soft, fluffy feathers. Others say they enjoy the coos a happy Radien makes.",
"Even more unusual is how quite a few Radien enjoy being in intimate relationships with races like Novakid. They also, strangely enough, seem offended and disgusted when questioned about relationships between their own species. Reasons are unknown at this point in time."
