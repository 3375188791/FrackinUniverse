"What caused the mass wiping of Radien from the universe is a debated mystery to us. Even Ruppur does not wish to talk about it. Another team claims it may have been an alien invasion-- some of my team suggests it to be another classic 'Dinosaur mass extinction', via meteor or volcanic eruptions.",
"I, personally, believe it was a devastating contagious disease in the form of a parasite. By studying some Radien cores in recently abandoned ghost towns, I can find plenty of small holes that, when scanned, show a map of unnerving tunnels. Some still had eggs in them. I can't imagine how painful that must have been.",
"With my hypothesis, the only thing I'm missing is the catalyst for this disease. Perhaps that other team had a lead- they speculated it to be an Anodyne invasion, but perhaps it was a horrible sadistic creature that created this parasite and unleashed it upon the hapless Radien race. It's a mystery that may never be solved."
