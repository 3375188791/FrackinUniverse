    "After careful examination of subject 9, I've been able to ascertain some most unusual details on the symbiote itself based on the physiology of the host. Host is human, no doubt there...there is too little body hair for this to be Apex, not to mention a complete lack of pronounced brow ridge. Based on medical data of the human species I have determined that the subject was dead for at least 24 hours prior to melding with the symbiote.",
    "Cause of death is apparently a prion of unknown origin that is keyed specifically to the human genome. It appears to be unhinged from standard quantum space, able to straddle the interdimensional realm we call sub-space and utilize this as a means of transmission. This would, interestingly enough, allow the prion to infect anyone it wanted within a range of approximately 2 light years. More research on this prion will be conducted later.",
    "The symbiote itself appears to be attracted to this prion. When the symbiote reaches a distance of approximately 2 meters from the host, the human corpse, it affixes itself to the base of their neck. There, it injects a needle of sorts directly into the cerebellum. It is at this point that some form of chemical reaction with the prion allows it to re-animate the dead tissue and gain complete control over the deceased brain. All brain activity re-activates. This has been demonstrated in all 422 subjects found at the crash site.",
    "The symbiote then becomes ambulatory within the body of the host. Symbiote itself appears sentient, but utterly unable to affect the world in a meaningful way without the presence of the host body. A curious species, to be sure. As it poses no threat to anyone but a human infected and killed by this prion, I am classifying it as a type-12 threat. We will inform the Protectorate of the discovery, and let them determine how to react to this new 'race'. As it is no threat to Hylotl, and of no profitable gain to the Letheia Corporation, case file will now be closed."
